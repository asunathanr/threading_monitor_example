I want to rock!(Rock!)
I want to rock!(Rock!)
I want to rock!(Rock!)
I want to rock!(Rock!)
Turn it down you say
But all I got to say to you is time and time again I say No!
No! No! No!
Tell me not to play
Well, all I got to say to when you tell me not to play I say No!
No! No! No!
So, if you ask me why I like the way I play it
There's only one thing I can say to you
